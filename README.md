# BLAKE2b

NOTE: If you happen to stumble upon this, don't use it for proper use.

This is a simple implementation of BLAKE2b in Rust, with an added tool to get a nice printable checksum of a file.

### Usage:

```toml
blake2b = { git = "https://github.com/eggmund/BLAKE2b-rshttps://github.com/eggmund/BLAKE2b-rs" }
```

to your `Cargo.toml` file in the root directory of your project.

### TO DO:
- Proper tests.
